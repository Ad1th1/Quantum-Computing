# Quantum-Computing

This repository is a documentation of my journey.
A journey that enables me to explore the world of the minuscule particles of the universe, and find the magical link that enables awesome 
computations!

This journey began on the 13th of April, 2022 and is an ongoing-expedition.

I hope to learn from this vast field, and perhaps one-day give back to this ocean of knowledge that we have with us, and answer some of the 
elegant and spiritual questions quantum mechanics asks of us....
