## Rules of reflection 
> - light reflects off of smooth surfaces 
> - The incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal lie in the same plane 
> - The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection

## Refraction
> - when light travelling in a transparent medium enters another transparent medium, it bends unless it falls on the second medium normally

## Rules of refraction: 
> - The incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal lie in the same plane
> - (sin(i)/sin(r)) = u

## Characteristic behaviours of light: 
> - particle model of light(corpuscules) -> Newton 
> - explains translatory motion of light 
> - explains reflection(imagine light particles being shiny rubber balls) 
> - refraction explained by surface attraction 
> - different colours = different light particles

## Christian Huygens 
> - suggested that light travels as a wave motion 
> - light is propogated by particles of this aether medium 
> - spherical ripples in 3-D -> ripples are wavefronts = set of particles vibrating in sync with each other(ie: particles are in phase) 
> - for sources infinitely far away, wavefronts appear to be a plane 
> - advantage of light being a wave? colors could be explained by wavelengths
