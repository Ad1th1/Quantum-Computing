-> Exists theoretically

-> impossible to break\
-> uses Heisenberg's principle\
-> key is a stream of photons

-> first tried out in 1989

Post Quantum Cryptography or Quantum Resistant Technology\
 -> refers to mathematical methods of encryption that quantum computers do not have an advantage
 
Quantum - key Distribution:\
-> method for two parties to securely share keys\
-> 4 filters -> up,down,left, right\
-> photons are sent by Alice using random filters\
-> anyone else who intercepts and detects these photons runs the risk of changing it because of the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle\
-> Bob detects photons using random filters of his own and gets a result\
-> Then Alice sends her key over an unencrypted channel and Bob keeps the ones on his side that were right. These are then exchanged and a common key is 
obtained

-> In quantum mechanics, it is impossible to copy an arbitrary state without destroying it => no cloning theorem
